Koji Dynamic Soundboard
-----------------------
This application is written in C# and is used to easily create your needed soundboard for whatever purpose.
You can add sounds, change each volume, play, stop and pause.
I found it useful for my acting class, when performing a play this helps a lot in playing various sounds of the soundtrack.
